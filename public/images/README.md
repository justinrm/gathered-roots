- Use only high-quality, professional, authentic photos (no generic stock).
- Prioritize images of clean homes, happy clients, and team members.
- Recommended image types:
  - Hero/landing images (e.g., sparkling clean living room, happy family)
  - Service-specific images (e.g., cleaning in action, eco-friendly products)
  - Team photos (authentic, professional)
  - Testimonial author photos (real clients, if available)
- All images must have descriptive, meaningful alt text for accessibility (e.g., `alt="Clean modern living room"`).
- Optimize images for web (compress, use modern formats like WebP if possible).
