# Project Overview: Gathered Roots Cleaning Website

## 1. Introduction

Gathered Roots Cleaning is a cleaning business requiring a professional, modern, and user-friendly website to attract and engage potential customers, showcase services, and facilitate bookings or quote requests. The website will serve as the primary digital storefront and a key tool for business growth.

<!-- Idea: Consider a tagline that reflects the "Gathered Roots Cleaning" name â€“ perhaps something about grounding, natural cleanliness, or a fresh start. -->

## 2. Project Goals

- **Primary Goal:** Generate leads and convert visitors into customers by providing clear service information and easy-to-use contact/booking methods.
- **Secondary Goals:**
  - Establish a strong brand presence for Gathered Roots Cleaning that conveys professionalism, trustworthiness, and a commitment to quality.
  - Provide comprehensive information about services offered, service areas, and the company's values.
  - Optimize for local SEO to ensure high visibility in search results for relevant keywords in the target service areas.
  - Ensure a seamless and positive user experience across all devices, with a focus on mobile-friendliness and accessibility.
  - Achieve high Lighthouse scores for Performance, Accessibility, and SEO.

## 3. Target Audience

- **Primary:** Homeowners and renters within the specified service areas who are seeking reliable and professional cleaning services. This includes busy professionals, families, individuals needing move-in/move-out cleaning, or those looking for regular home maintenance.
- **Secondary:** Small businesses or offices looking for commercial cleaning services (if applicable).

<!-- Idea: Could we gather some demographic data or create user personas for the primary audience to better tailor content and design? E.g., "Busy Brenda", "New Mover Mike". -->

## 4. Scope of Work

### Core Pages:

- **Homepage:** Engaging introduction, summary of services, unique selling propositions (USPs), testimonials, and clear calls-to-action (CTAs).
- **About Us:** Company story, mission, values, and potentially team member introductions (if desired) to build trust.
- **Services Offered:** Detailed descriptions of each cleaning service (e.g., Standard Clean, Deep Clean, Move-In/Out Clean, Eco-Friendly Options). Each service page should include benefits and a specific CTA.
  - <!-- Idea: For each service, consider a small checklist of what's included. -->
- **Service Areas:** Clearly defined list or map of geographic areas served.
- **Testimonials/Reviews:** Showcase positive customer feedback to build credibility.
- **FAQ:** Answers to common questions about services, pricing, booking process, etc.
- **Contact/Booking:** Easy-to-use contact form, phone number, email address, and potentially an integrated booking/quote request system.
- **Privacy Policy:** Clearly outlining data usage and protection.
- **Terms of Service (if applicable):** Especially if online booking and payments are implemented.

### Key Features & Functionality:

- **Responsive Design:** Optimal viewing and interaction experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Minimalist & Modern Aesthetic:** Clean layout, intuitive navigation, high-quality imagery, and modern typography. The color palette will feature peaceful and modern shades of green and teal, complemented by clean neutrals, to evoke trust, calm, and a connection to nature.
- **Clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs):** Prominently displayed buttons like "Request a Quote," "Book Now," "Learn More."
- **Contact Forms:** Secure and user-friendly forms for inquiries and quote requests.
- **SEO Optimization:**
  - Keyword research and implementation.
  - Meta titles, descriptions, and OpenGraph tags for all key pages.
  - `schema.org` markup for `LocalBusiness` and `Service`.
  - Fast loading speeds.
- **Accessibility:** Adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.
- **Blog/Tips Section (Optional Future Enhancement):** To share cleaning tips, company news, or articles that can improve SEO and customer engagement.
  - <!-- Idea: A blog could be a great way to target long-tail keywords related to cleaning. -->

### Technology Stack (Recommendations based on `.cursorrules`):

- **Frontend:** React (potentially with Next.js for SSR/SSG benefits)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Backend (if needed for advanced booking/CMS):** Node.js
- **Deployment:** (To be determined - e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS)

## 5. Non-Goals (Scope Limitations from `.cursorrules`)

- Complex e-commerce systems for direct online payment (unless specifically requested later). Simple booking/quote forms are preferred initially.
- Intrusive pop-ups or aggressive marketing trackers.
- Overly technical jargon in website copy.
- Flashy or cluttered designs that detract from the professional, trustworthy image.

## 6. Success Metrics

- Increase in qualified leads (form submissions, phone calls).
- Improved search engine rankings for target keywords.
- Higher website engagement (e.g., time on page, lower bounce rate).
- Positive user feedback on website usability and design.
- High Lighthouse scores (Performance, Accessibility, SEO).

<!-- Idea: Set up analytics (e.g., Google Analytics 4) from day one to track these metrics. -->
